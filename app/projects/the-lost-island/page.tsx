            <p className="pr-[30%] mb-20">This game was built for the game design and -development course at Medialogy, Aalborg Copenhagen. All programming and implementation of systems done by me, Peter DÃ¸nvang. The idea for this game was to make a horror game including themes of climate change. Featuring a dark atmosphere and a chaotic environment of screams, ominous background sound design and blinking lights, the game was commended by our professor for being very intense and immersive. Given more time during the semester specifically for this project, some of the code would have looked very different. However in the timeframe given, I am very satisfied with the result.</p>

            <CodeWithExplanation code={villagerBehavoirCode}>
                The Villager class is fairly sparse, having most of the functionality called from the Player class when interacted with.
